                            1. More than 4.5 million patients need blood transfusions each year in the U.S. and Canada. <br> 2. 43,000 pints: amount of donated blood used each day in the U.S. and Canada.<br> 3. Someone needs blood every two seconds.<br>                            4. Only 37 percent of the U.S. population is eligible to donate blood – less than 10 percent do annually.<br> 5. About 1 in 7 people entering a hospital need blood.<br> 6. One pint of blood can save up to three lives.<br> 7.
                            Dr. Karl Landsteiner first identified the major human blood groups – A, B, AB and O – in 1901.<br> 8. One unit of blood can be separated into several components: red blood cells, plasma, platelets and cryoprecipitate.<br> 9.
                            Red blood cells carry oxygen to the body’s organs and tissues.<br> 10. Red blood cells live about 120 days in the circulatory system.<br>

                            <strong>According to the National Centre for Blood, 95, 806 blood units were distributed in 65 hospitals across Rwanda in 2018.<br>

                                These blood units were collected from 548 mobile blood collection sites established in community, private or public institutions as well as five fixed sites located at every regional blood transfusion center.<br><br>
                                
                                 
                                Although figures show how steady the sector is, misconceptions and myths about blood transfusion and blood donation have proven to be a major challenge.<br>
                                
                                 
                                The Division Manager of the National Center for Blood Transfusion, Dr. Swaibu Gatare, told Sunday Times possible myths and misconceptions held by the community on blood transfusion and donation.<br><br><br>

                                <br>Gatare told Sunday Times that the conditions and process set for people to donate blood are not discriminatory as some in the public might think.
                                
                                He explains that blood donor eligibility conditions follow international standards and were set in order to ensure safety of both a blood donor and recipient.
                                
                                “Our process is not discriminatory but it’s strict only because we want to ensure that the quality of the blood and safety of beneficiaries,” he said.
                                
                                For instance, he explains, men having sex with men and sex workers are excluded from blood donors because chances are high for them to acquire HIV virus.<br><br><br>

                                <br>He explained that in a situation where a patient lost a significant amount of blood or got injured, fresh whole blood is better. After 24 hours of storage, blood loses some of its components that might be helpful to the patient.
                                
                                However, fresh blood transmitted to a malaria patient might be risky.
                                
                                “When transmitting blood to a malaria patient, some blood components are needed. It is better to use stored blood, which has lost the unwanted components, to meet the patient’s needs. When it is not done, fresh blood might lead to other health issues like breathing complications,” he explains.
